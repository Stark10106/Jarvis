The transmission charge waiver on renewable energy is spread over each unit of non-renewable energy consumed, cost of non-renewable electricity gets inflated, in turn worsening its cost competitiveness and nudging consumers towards a larger share of renewables in the overall consumption mix.

Financial benefit from central grid charge waiver for renewables has consistently been higher than the government’s budgetary outlay for supporting renewable transition.

The Indian government's waiver of Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) charges for renewable energy projects has significantly influenced the country's energy landscape. This policy has made renewable energy sources more financially attractive, leading to increased adoption. 
**Impact on Renewable Energy Adoption:**

- **Cost Competitiveness:** By waiving ISTS charges, the government has reduced the overall cost of transmitting renewable energy. This reduction enhances the competitiveness of renewable energy compared to traditional fossil fuels, encouraging higher investment and adoption rates.
    
- **Policy Extensions:** Recognizing the positive impact of the waiver, the government has extended this policy multiple times. For instance, the waiver has been extended for projects commissioned by June 30, 2025, demonstrating the government's commitment to promoting renewable energy.
    
- **Future Outlook:** The ISTS charge waiver is set to be phased out by 2028. This planned phase-out indicates that while the waiver has been instrumental in promoting renewable energy, the government anticipates that the renewable sector will become self-sustaining and competitive without such incentives in the future.

By virtue of having built a robust national power transmission grid, India was able to add c.70GW solar capacity between FY14-23, without material corresponding investment in the grid.  India had **already developed a national power transmission network**, which had sufficient capacity to **integrate new solar projects** without requiring large additional investments.

Reasons for shifting to RE - India’s levelised cost for RTC RE is currently 27% lower than that of China, driven by cheaper RE costs overall. When combined with India’s higher average grid tariff vs. that of China, it begins to make economic sense for consumers (especially corporates, which are charged even higher grid tariffs) to shift to RTC RE. Similarly, India has a materially lower RE LCoE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) vs. Europe and it is competitive with that in US, despite having a significantly higher cost of debt (key cost item for RE projects). 1) Green Open Access: which allows consumers above 100kw of load to directly purchase power from renewable developers bilaterally, and 2) Direct central grid access to large industrial consumers, bypassing the state T&D infrastructure. Both of these were aimed towards limiting the state’s ability to utilise physical infrastructure as a constraint on energy cost optimisation, given the perverse retail tariff structure in India across most states.
