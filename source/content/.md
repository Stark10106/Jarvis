## Assignment: Predicting California House Prices with NumPy

### Objective

The goal of this assignment is to build a linear regression model from scratch to predict house prices in California. You will implement the entire modeling process using only the NumPy library, gaining a deep, fundamental understanding of the core mechanics behind machine learning models.

### Core Requirements

1. **NumPy Only:** All parts of the model implementation including the forward pass, loss calculation, gradient descent, and evaluation metrics - must be done using only NumPy. You may not use high-level libraries like PyTorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn for the modeling components. You can use Matplotlib for visualization of data.
    
2. **Google Colab:** You must complete your work in a Google Colab notebook. This will be your final submission file.
    
3. **Dataset Setup:** You are required to handle the data manually. The steps are:
    - Download the dataset's CSV file from Kaggle.
    - Upload the `housing.csv` file to your Google Drive.
    - Mount your Google Drive within your Colab notebook.
    - Load the data into your notebook from your mounted Drive using Pandas. After loading, you should convert the data into NumPy arrays for the rest of the assignment.
