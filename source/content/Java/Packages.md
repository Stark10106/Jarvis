Packages in Java are a mechanism that encapsulates a group of classes, sub-packages, and interfaces. Classes in the same package can access each other's package-private and protected members. In general, a package can contain the following kinds of types - classes, interfaces, enumerations, records and annotation types.
### Why use Packages?
- **Avoid Class Name Conflicts** - Two classes with the same name can coexist if they‚Äôre in different packages.
- **Modular Organization** - Group related classes (e.g., `java.util`, `java.io`) for better code structure. These classes will all be related in some way ‚Äì they might all have to do with a specific application or perform a specific set of tasks.
- **Access Protection** - Packages work with access modifiers (`public`, `protected`, default, `private`) to control visibility.
- **Reusability** - Code can be reused easily if properly organized in packages.
### Using Packages
In a Java source file, the package that this file's class or classes belong to is specified with the `package`keyword. The package statement must be the first line in the source file (excluding comments). At most one package declaration can appear in a source file.

`package java.awt.event;`- this creates the package
`import java.awt.event.*;`- imports all classes from the `java.awt.event` package
`import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;`- imports only the `ActionEvent` class from the package

Classes can also be used directly without an import declaration by using the fully qualified name of the class. `java.awt.event.ActionEvent myEvent = new java.awt.event.ActionEvent();`does not require a preceding import declaration.

### Package Naming Conventions
1. Reverse Domain Name: Use your domain name in reverse as the base of your package names. For example, if your domain is `example.com`, start your package with `com.example`.
2. Lowercase Names: Use lowercase letters to avoid conflicts with class names.
3. Meaningful Names: Use descriptive and meaningful names to reflect the content of the package.
   
### Static Import
Static import  allows members (fields and methods) which have been scoped within their container class as`public static`, to be used in Java code without specifying the class in which the field has been defined.

According to SUN microSystem, it will improve the code readability and enhance coding. But according to the programming experts, it will lead to confusion and not good for programming. If there is no specific requirement then we should not go for static import.

By using static import, if user wants to access any static member of class then less coding is required. However, static import makes the program unreadable and unmaintainable if you are reusing this feature, especially in large codebases or projects with multiple developers. Also, if two static members of the same name are imported from multiple different classes, the compiler will throw an error, as it will not be able to determine which member to use in the absence of class name qualification.

With the help of import, we are able to access classes and interfaces which are present in any package. But using static import, we can access all the static members (variables and methods) of a class directly without explicitly calling class name.

```java
// Calling of predefined methods without static import
class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println(Math.sqrt(4));
        System.out.println(Math.pow(2, 2));
        System.out.println(Math.abs(6.3));
    }
}

// Calling of predefined methods without static import
import static java.lang.Math.*;
class Test2 {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println(sqrt(4));
        System.out.println(pow(2, 2));
        System.out.println(abs(6.3));
    }
}

// Calling of static member of System class without Class name
// System is a class present in java.lang package and out is a static variable present in System class.
import static java.lang.Math.*;
import static java.lang.System.*;
class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        out.println(sqrt(4));
        out.println(pow(2, 2));
        out.println(abs(6.3));
    }
}

// Ambiguity in static import
import static java.lang.Integer.*;
import static java.lang.Byte.*;
public class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        system.out.println(MAX_VALUE); // Error:Reference to MAX_VALUE is ambiguous
    }
}
// In the above program, we are trying to access MAX_VALUE variable, but Every primitive data type contains MAX_VALUE variable which is pre-declared in there Wrapper class. Here we are importing Integer and Byte class simultaneously and trying to access static variable MAX_VALUE but here compiler will be confused by seeing two import statements because both Integer and Byte class contains a static variable MAX_VALUE. Therefore here compiler throw an error saying Reference to MAX_VALUE is ambiguous.

```


### Built-in Packages

#### java.lang
Provides classes fundamental to the Java language and is automatically imported.

#### java.lang.Math

The floorMod method aims to solve a long-standing problem with integer
remainders. Consider the expression n % 2. Everyone knows that this is 0 if n
is even and 1 if n is odd. Except, of course, when n is odd and negative. Then
it is -1. Why? When the first computers were built, someone had to make
rules for how integer division and remainder should work for negative
operands. Mathematicians had known the optimal (or ‚ÄúEuclidean‚Äù) rule for a
few hundred years: always leave the remainder ‚â• 0. But, rather than open a
math textbook, those pioneers came up with rules that seemed reasonable but
are actually inconvenient.
Consider this problem. You compute the position of the hour hand of a
clock. An adjustment is applied, and you want to normalize to a number
between 0 and 11. That is easy: (position + adjustment) % 12. But what if
the adjustment is negative? Then you might get a negative number. So you
have to introduce a branch, or use ((position + adjustment) % 12 + 12) %
12. Either way, it is a hassle.
The floorMod method makes it easier: floorMod(position + adjustment,
13) always yields a value between 0 and 11. (Unfortunately, floorMod gives
negative results for negative divisors, but that situation doesn‚Äôt often occur
in practice.)

##### Methods

###### Instance Methods

1. **`char charAt(int¬†index)`-** Returns the `char` value at the specified index. Negative index do not work
2.  **`int¬†codePointAt(int¬†index)`-** Returns the character (Unicode code point) at the specified index.
3. **`int¬†codePointBefore(int¬†index)`-** Returns the character (Unicode code point) before the specified index. 
4. **`int¬†codePointCount(int¬†beginIndex, int¬†endIndex)`-** Returns the number of Unicode code points in the specified text range of this `String`.
   Java's `String.length()` method doesn't count the number of characters you _see_. It counts the number of 16-bit `char` units in the string's internal storage.
- A simple character like `'A'` is stored as one `char`.
- A supplementary character like `'üòÇ'` is stored as a **surrogate pair** (two `char`s).
  
A **code point** is simply the numerical value assigned to a single character in the Unicode standard. 'H' has a code point, and the emoji 'üòÇ' also has a single code point (`U+1F602`). The `codePointCount(int beginIndex, int endIndex)` method is designed for this exact purpose. It iterates through a string and counts the code points, not the `char`s.

**How it works:**
- It looks at each `char` in the specified range.
- If a `char` is a regular character, it adds 1 to the count.
- If it finds a high surrogate, it checks if it's followed by a low surrogate. If so, it counts the entire pair as just one code point and skips the low surrogate.

5. **`int¬†compareTo(String¬†anotherString)`-** Compares two strings lexicographically. The comparison is based on the Unicode value of each character in the strings. The character sequence represented by this `String` object is compared lexicographically to the character sequence represented by the argument string. The result is a negative integer if this `String` object lexicographically precedes the argument string. The result is a positive integer if this `String` object lexicographically follows the argument string. The result is zero if the strings are equal; `compareTo` returns `0` exactly when the`equals(Object)`method would return `true`.

This is the definition of lexicographic ordering. If two strings are different, then either they have different characters at some index that is a valid index for both strings, or their lengths are different, or both. If they have different characters at one or more index positions, let _k_ be the smallest such index; then the string whose character at position _k_ has the smaller value, as determined by using the < operator, lexicographically precedes the other string. In this case, `compareTo` returns the difference of the two character values at position `k` in the two string -- that is, the value:

>  `this.charAt(k)-anotherString.charAt(k)`
>  

If there is no index position at which they differ, then the shorter string lexicographically precedes the longer string. In this case, `compareTo` returns the difference of the lengths of the strings -- that is, the value:

>  `this.length()-anotherString.length()`

6. **`int¬†compareToIgnoreCase(String¬†str)`-** Compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case differences.
7. `String concat(String str)`- Concatenates the specified string to the end of this string.
8. **`boolean¬†contains(CharSequence s)`-** Returns true if and only if this string contains the specified sequence of char values.`s` - the sequence to search for. Checks whether a given sequence of characters (substring) exists **anywhere** within the target string.
