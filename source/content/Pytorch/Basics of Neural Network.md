		1. `torch.nn.MSELoss(size_average=None,reduce=None,reduction='mean')` - Creates a criterion that measures the mean squared error (squared L2 norm) between each element in the input x and target y. Penalizes large errors more than small errors due to the squared term. Works best when the data has normally distributed errors$$MSE = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} | y_i - \hat{y}_i |^2$$
