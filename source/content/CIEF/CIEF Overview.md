## Indian English Literature (IEL): Critique & Defense

- Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children (1981) opened the floodgates of literary activity in English.
- Many Indian English Fiction writers achieved critical acclaim & commercial success at home and abroad.
- According to conservative Indian critics, IEL authors suffer from a condition called “Rushdie-itis”. The symptoms are as follows
	- Imposition of Western cultural standards (of writers, critics, and publishers) on India
	- Many new IEL writers living outside India
	- Their work lacking the spiritual dimension essential for understanding of the soul of India
	- Their insufficient grounding in the ancient Indian literary traditions
	- IEL as the literary equivalent of MTV culture
	- IEL authors’ promotion of Coca-Colonisation

### Pre-Rushdie Indian English Fiction
- Rushdie is hailed as a real innovator in Indian English Fiction
- IEF does not have a long continuous tradition
- Why is literary tradition important to writers? They would prefer to belong to a tradition even if they finally choose to reject it
- In the case of pre-Independence Indian English authors, there was no concrete
- tradition in terms of language, nation, region, nationality, or even literary genre &
- style that they could belong to or call their own
- The absence of tradition makes the IEF author feel like an orphan/foster child
- But the lack of an oppressive tradition makes the IEF author feel liberated (alternative perspective)

## 1930s - 1940 (Midnight's Parents)

The Indian English Fiction (IEF) authors of the 1930s and 1940s are often referred to as "**Midnight's Parents**". This era marked a significant period for the genre, which gained visibility with the emergence of a "triumvirate" of major writers: Mulk Raj Anand, R.K. Narayan, and Raja Rao. Their work was pivotal in the evolution of Indian novels in English, coinciding with the rise of Indian nationalism, heavily influenced by figures like Gandhi. Many of these writers, including Anand and Rao, spent time in Europe, contributing to a cultural hybridity in their work.

- Tradition of IEF starts with Bankim Chatterjee’s Rajmohan’s Wife (1864)
- Few Indian writers wrote in English after Bankim without success or impact
- In the 1930s Indian English Fiction gained visibility with the emergence of the triumvirate:
- Mulk Raj Anand (Untouchable, p. 1935), R.K. Narayan (Swami & Friends, p. 1935), and Raja Rao (Kanthapura, p. 1938)
- Books endorsed by big British novelists: E.M. Forster and Graham Greene
- Their writings were situated between two widely different cultural worlds: India & England; Indian languages & English (m/other tongue)
- Complex negotiation between the cultures of metropolitan centre and colonial periphery

Unlike earlier Indian English writers of the 19th century, their work was not considered derivative. Instead, they drew inspiration from India's narrative traditions while being shaped by modern literary and political thought from abroad. Their writings were situated between the distinct cultural worlds of India and England, as well as Indian languages and English. These authors undertook a complex negotiation between the cultures of the metropolitan center and the colonial periphery. They are recognized for laying the foundation for contemporary Indian writing in English through their experimentation with social realism, cultural hybridity, and linguistic innovation.

A crucial factor in the visibility of Mulk Raj Anand, R.K. Narayan, and Raja Rao was that their books were endorsed by prominent British novelists like E.M. Forster and Graham Greene.

- In his influential foreword to _Kanthapura_ (1938), he highlighted the **inherently bilingual nature of his literary endeavor**. He articulated the challenge: "**One has to convey in a language that is not one’s own; the spirit that is one’s own. One has to convey the various shades and omissions of a certain thought-movement that looks maltreated in an alien language**".
- He clarified that English was not truly "alien" because it was "**the language of our intellectual make-up, like Sanskrit or Persian was before, but not of our emotional make-up**".
- Rao observed that many Indians are "**instinctively bilingual, many of us writing in our own language and in English**". He stressed that Indian writers "cannot write like the English. We should not. We cannot write only as Indians. We have grown to look at the large world as part of us".
- He envisioned that the Indian method of expression would develop into "**a dialect which will some day prove to be as distinctive and colorful as the Irish or the American**". This was part of the "real language problem: how to bend it, how to shape it, how to make it be our freedom, how to repossess its poisoned walls".
- Regarding style, he emphasized that "**The tempo of Indian life must be infused into our English expression, even as the tempo of American or Irish life has gone into the making of theirs**".

#### Influence of Modernism and Marxism

## Post-Independence Fiction (1950s-70s)

Indian English Fiction (IEF) in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s marked a significant period following India's Independence. During this time, writing in English faced challenges, with some considering it unpatriotic and raising tensions about language, identity, and cultural authenticity. Despite these challenges, authors of this era laid the groundwork for the global recognition of Indian English literature, paving the way for the "Rushdie generation" of the 1980s and 1990s.

### Theme 1: Alienation & Identity

#### Theoretical Framework
In the IEF of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, Alienation & Identity is characterized by the struggle of an alienated individual or character navigating modernity and tradition. This theme also encompasses the **elite writer’s detachment from the masses**. During the post-Independence period, writing in English was viewed by some as unpatriotic and even a "cultural betrayal", leading to tensions regarding language, identity, and cultural authenticity. The absence of a long, continuous literary tradition in IEF could make an author feel like an "orphan/foster child". Raja Rao highlights this linguistic and emotional disconnect, stating that English is the "language of our intellectual make-up" but "not of our emotional make-up," which can contribute to a sense of "alien" expression for Indian writers.

#### Case Study Analysis 
Several authors from this period explored themes of alienation and identity in their works:

- **Arun Joshi** directly addressed **alienation** and **existential crises**, influenced by Western philosophers like Camus and Sartre. His novel, _The Foreigner_ (1968), portrays a young man's search for belonging and redemption, illustrating a character grappling with his place in the world. _The Strange Case of Billy Biswas_ (1971) further explores this by depicting a US-returned Indian who finds an antidote to urban disillusionment in tribal life, signifying a search for an authentic identity away from modern societal norms.
- **Kamala Markandaya** examined the conflict between tradition and modernity and the intersection of rural and urban lives. Her novel, _The Nowhere Man_ (1972), explicitly addresses **racial prejudice in Britain**, directly illustrating the profound experience of alienation and identity struggle faced by characters in a foreign land. Furthermore, the general struggle of Indian writers to defend their choice of English as a literary language, as seen in Markandaya's "strident" assertion of "this is my language, this is my voice" [0:59:58-0:59:59], demonstrates a broader struggle against perceived cultural alienation.
- **Manohar Malgonkar**’s themes often included the clash between tradition and modernity.
- **Nayantara Sahgal**’s _A Time to Be Happy_ (1958) examined **elite identity crises** and societal transformation during Independence, focusing on the personal identity and the intersection of public and private lives for the Western-educated Indian elite.

### Theme 2: Emergence of Women Writers & Struggles in a Patriarchal Society

#### Theoretical Framework
The 1950s-1970s saw the emergence of women writers in IEF, who began exploring women’s experiences in relation to tradition and modernity. Their works often delved into the **psychological depth and emotional struggles of women within patriarchal systems**. These writers faced significant challenges, as their **gender could determine their experiences**, leading to **denied experiences and limited access to power, books, and media**. Consequently, women writers often had to assert their place in the literary space, confronting issues similar to those faced by "any other middle class working woman".

#### Case Study Analysis
Women novelists of this era provided significant insights into these themes:

- **Anita Desai** is a prominent figure whose themes include **existential anxiety, emotional isolation, and the inner lives of women**. Her novel, _Cry, the Peacock_ (1963), is a psychological exploration of a woman’s unraveling marriage. _Clear Light of Day_ (1980) addresses tensions within a post-partition Indian family and the **status of women**, particularly their roles as mothers and caretakers, in modern-day India. The discussion in the "Our Novels In English Full Movie" transcript characterizes Desai's writing, exemplified by _In Custody_, as "very beautiful" but concerning a "refined existence" and an "unhappy, slightly neurotic me sahib world" [0:59:04-0:59:22]. This commentary highlights the challenges women writers faced in treating such subjects with the right amount of seriousness without diminishing or overdoing them [0:59:45-1:00:00].
- **Kamala Markandaya**’s _Nectar in a Sieve_ (1954) offers a poignant portrayal of a **peasant woman’s struggle for survival** and happiness in a changing India. Her "strident" defense of English as "my language, this is my voice" [0:59:58-1:00:00] can be interpreted as an act of asserting female agency and challenging patriarchal norms within the literary sphere.
- **Nayantara Sahgal** specifically focused on the **struggles of women in patriarchal systems**. Her novel _Rich Like Us_ (1985), set during the Emergency, intertwines a critique of authoritarianism with explicit themes of **gender oppression**.
- **Shashi Deshpande**, though a slightly later figure, is recognized for having "sketched with sensitive detail the **conflicts and inner lives of urban middleclass women**", further contributing to the representation of women's experiences during this broader period.

### Major IEF Novelists (1950s-1970s)

## Visions of India (Gandhi vs. Nehru)

Here is a detailed comparative analysis of the visions for post-Independence India held by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, along with the subsequent fragmentation of national politics:

### Detailed Visions for India

#### Mahatma Gandhi's Vision

- **Economic Development:**
    - Gandhi's vision for economic development was **rural-centric**.
    - He championed **self-reliance** and **village upliftment**.
    - His philosophy emphasized **anti-modernist attitudes**.
- **Religion & National Identity:**
    - Gandhi advocated for a **broad and inclusive sense of religion**.
    - His vision focused on **non-aggression**.
    - He emphasized **traditional Indian values**.
- **Language Policy:**
    - Gandhi held a **pragmatic view** that encouraged the **use of English for communication**.
    - **[MISSING from sources]**: Specific details on Gandhi's comprehensive post-Independence language policy beyond pragmatic communication were not found.

#### Jawaharlal Nehru's Vision

- **Economic Development:**
    - Nehru's policies were aimed at **state-sponsored investments for economic growth**.
    - His vision was characterized by **Marxist-inspired modernity and socialism**.
    - His state-sponsored investments included specific projects like **ISRO, IITs, and hydro-power dams**. His economic model, which emphasized that the state **retained control and not private companies**, was inspired by **Soviet Russia**. His goal of a "pluralistic nation" was a direct response to India being a diverse **"Cultural pot"**.
- **Religion & National Identity:**
    - Nehru's secular ideals aimed at creating a **secular and unified India**.
    - He focused on **protecting cultural and religious diversity**, avoiding singular definitions of identity.
- **Language Policy:**
    - Nehru's policy designated **English as the language of the state**, with Hindi and regional languages serving as official languages.

### Comparison and Literary Tension

Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru presented two distinct, often contrasting, visions for post-Independence India. Gandhi's ideology centered on **rural simplicity, traditional Indian values, and an anti-modernist approach to development**. He envisioned a nation rooted in self-reliance and an inclusive sense of religion. In stark contrast, Nehru championed **Marxist-inspired modernity, state-sponsored economic growth, and secular ideals** aimed at a unified India that protected its diverse cultural and religious identities. He saw English as the language of the state, alongside Hindi and regional languages.

The tension or synthesis between these competing ideologies—between **rural simplicity and Marxist-inspired modernity**—was a common and significant theme for writers of the era. Their novels often served as precursors to postcolonial literature, grappling with issues of **identity and nationalism** while attempting to bridge tradition and modernity.

### 3. The Fragmentation of National Politics (1970s-80s)

The period of the 1970s and 1980s witnessed a significant **fragmentation of national politics** in India. This era saw the **rise of regional and caste-based political movements**. These movements led to demands for **regional autonomy** in various states, notably in **Punjab, Assam, and Kashmir**.

During Indira Gandhi's governance, secularism was redefined amid political unrest, and her administration employed **controversial measures, including political imprisonment**, before her assassination in 1984.

A stark example of the conflict between the central government and regional movements was when the Indian Air Force bombed people in Mizoram for demanding independence.

The poem **"Desperately Seeking India" by G.J.V. Prasad**, originally composed in the early 1980s, serves as a direct literary response to this period of fragmentation and alienation. The poem vividly illustrates the internal divisions and conflicts within India, with lines like:

- "In Delhi Without a visa / In Madras An Aryan spy".
- "Kashmir’s no vacation / They tell me it’s a nation / And Punjab wants to die".
- "In Bombay I’m an invader / In Assam An exploiting trader".
- The concluding lines, "They would throw me / From the hills / Kick me / From the plains / I promise / Never to mention / India again," powerfully convey a sense of a fractured identity and widespread alienation during this tumultuous period.
  


## Post Rushdie

### Arundhati Roy (b. 1961)
- Won The Booker Prize in 1997 for _The God of Small Things_, becoming the "first resident Indian to win Britain's most coveted literary award".  Before her, V.S. Naipaul won in 1971 and Salman Rushdie won in 1981, both were Indian descent but not Indian resident. So, this was a huge win for Indian literature and marked a turning point for Indian fiction globally.  
- Her success in winning the Booker stamped India as "the most fertile new literary ground in international eyes".
- Her book made "no allowances for a foreign audience" but was met with "Wild International excitement"

### V.S. Naipaul
- He was the first writer to make "the Great Leap" and prove that "neither poverty nor his obscure Beginnings...could stop him from becoming one of the greatest masters of the English language"
- Though his early work like _The Mystic Masseur_ was "scorned as a little Savory from the colonies" and _A House for Mr. Biswas_ was "greeted with indifference" in the 1950s, he is now considered "one of the greatest living writers in the English language"
- He wrote novels, short stories, essays and travelogs. 
- He wrote "with passion and Authority on subjects ranging from Life in the small island colonies of Trinidad and Tobago to cultural fundamentalism and Islam".
- The British establishment has honored him with a Knighthood, and Oxford University with an honorary doctorate, though these honors are "recent history".
- Unlike Narayan and Anand, Naipaul's works were not exclusively focused on Indian themes but rather on diverse subjects
