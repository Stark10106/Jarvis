## 1930s - 1940

The Indian English Fiction (IEF) authors of the 1930s and 1940s are often referred to as "**Midnight's Parents**". This era marked a significant period for the genre, which gained visibility with the emergence of a "triumvirate" of major writers: Mulk Raj Anand, R.K. Narayan, and Raja Rao. Their work was pivotal in the evolution of Indian novels in English, coinciding with the rise of Indian nationalism, heavily influenced by figures like Gandhi. Many of these writers, including Anand and Rao, spent time in Europe, contributing to a cultural hybridity in their work.

Unlike earlier Indian English writers of the 19th century, their work was not considered derivative. Instead, they drew inspiration from India's narrative traditions while being shaped by modern literary and political thought from abroad. Their writings were situated between the distinct cultural worlds of India and England, as well as Indian languages and English. These authors undertook a complex negotiation between the cultures of the metropolitan center and the colonial periphery. They are recognized for laying the foundation for contemporary Indian writing in English through their experimentation with social realism, cultural hybridity, and linguistic innovation.

A crucial factor in the visibility of Mulk Raj Anand, R.K. Narayan, and Raja Rao was that their books were endorsed by prominent British novelists like E.M. Forster and Graham Greene.

- He **rejected the elitism of the Bloomsbury Group**, instead advocating for **accessible prose and realism**.
- Marxism introduced a politically-motivated realism into his work, aligning with Marxist-inspired modernity and socialism, which often contrasted with Gandhian ideals of rural simplicity and traditional values.

### 2. R.K. Narayan (1906-2001)

#### Primary Themes
- Narayan's themes centered on **everyday life**, **human relationships**, and a **humorous yet poignant depiction of middle-class India**.
- His stories were frequently set in the **fictional South Indian town of Malgudi**.

- _**The Serpent and the Rope**_: Focused on metaphysics and Vedanta.
  
#### Cultural and Linguistic Negotiations (as described by Raja Rao in his foreword to 'Kanthapura')**:
- Raja Rao posed the fundamental question for Indian writers in English: "how does one convey in a language that is not one's own the spirit that is One's Own".
- In his influential foreword to _Kanthapura_ (1938), he highlighted the **inherently bilingual nature of his literary endeavor**. He articulated the challenge: "**One has to convey in a language that is not one’s own; the spirit that is one’s own. One has to convey the various shades and omissions of a certain thought-movement that looks maltreated in an alien language**".
- He clarified that English was not truly "alien" because it was "**the language of our intellectual make-up, like Sanskrit or Persian was before, but not of our emotional make-up**".
- Rao observed that many Indians are "**instinctively bilingual, many of us writing in our own language and in English**". He stressed that Indian writers "cannot write like the English. We should not. We cannot write only as Indians. We have grown to look at the large world as part of us".
- He envisioned that the Indian method of expression would develop into "**a dialect which will some day prove to be as distinctive and colorful as the Irish or the American**". This was part of the "real language problem: how to bend it, how to shape it, how to make it be our freedom, how to repossess its poisoned walls".
- Regarding style, he emphasized that "**The tempo of Indian life must be infused into our English expression, even as the tempo of American or Irish life has gone into the making of theirs**". He noted the quick pace of Indian thought and conversation, likening it to the "interminable tale" style of the Mahabharata and Ramayana, which he aimed to emulate in his narrative without traditional punctuation like "treacherous ‘ats’ and ‘ons’".
- He, Anand, Narayan, and Desani were instrumental in **indigenizing English**, infusing it with Indian rhythms and idioms. He was also a pioneer in experimenting with literary form during the 1920s and 30s.
  
#### Influence of Modernism and Marxism
- Raja Rao was part of the generation influenced by European modernism and Marxism.
- However, his central themes often championed **Gandhian philosophy** and traditional Indian spiritual values, which sometimes presented a counter-narrative to the Marxist-inspired modernity explored by some contemporaries.

### Key Texts

- Along with Anand, Narayan, and Rao, Desani was instrumental in **indigenizing English**, infusing it with Indian rhythms and idioms.
- The book initially fell into “complete anonymity” despite being championed by literary heavyweights like T.S. Eliot and Anthony Burgess, and was "almost forgotten for about 30 years" before its reissue in 1970.
- It later served as an **inspiration for Salman Rushdie** and his magnum opus _Midnight's Children_, which, like Desani's work, infused English expression with the “tempo and cadence of Indian life”.

## Post-Independence Fiction (1950s-70s)

Indian English Fiction (IEF) in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s marked a significant period following India's Independence. During this time, writing in English faced challenges, with some considering it unpatriotic and raising tensions about language, identity, and cultural authenticity. Despite these challenges, authors of this era laid the groundwork for the global recognition of Indian English literature, paving the way for the "Rushdie generation" of the 1980s and 1990s.

### Theme 1: Alienation & Identity

#### Theoretical Framework
In the IEF of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, Alienation & Identity is characterized by the struggle of an alienated individual or character navigating modernity and tradition. This theme also encompasses the **elite writer’s detachment from the masses**. During the post-Independence period, writing in English was viewed by some as unpatriotic and even a "cultural betrayal", leading to tensions regarding language, identity, and cultural authenticity. The absence of a long, continuous literary tradition in IEF could make an author feel like an "orphan/foster child". Raja Rao highlights this linguistic and emotional disconnect, stating that English is the "language of our intellectual make-up" but "not of our emotional make-up," which can contribute to a sense of "alien" expression for Indian writers.

#### Case Study Analysis 

Several authors from this period explored themes of alienation and identity in their works:

- **Arun Joshi** directly addressed **alienation** and **existential crises**, influenced by Western philosophers like Camus and Sartre. His novel, _The Foreigner_ (1968), portrays a young man's search for belonging and redemption, illustrating a character grappling with his place in the world. _The Strange Case of Billy Biswas_ (1971) further explores this by depicting a US-returned Indian who finds an antidote to urban disillusionment in tribal life, signifying a search for an authentic identity away from modern societal norms.
- **Kamala Markandaya** examined the conflict between tradition and modernity and the intersection of rural and urban lives. Her novel, _The Nowhere Man_ (1972), explicitly addresses **racial prejudice in Britain**, directly illustrating the profound experience of alienation and identity struggle faced by characters in a foreign land. Furthermore, the general struggle of Indian writers to defend their choice of English as a literary language, as seen in Markandaya's "strident" assertion of "this is my language, this is my voice" [0:59:58-0:59:59], demonstrates a broader struggle against perceived cultural alienation.
- **Manohar Malgonkar**’s themes often included the clash between tradition and modernity.
- **Nayantara Sahgal**’s _A Time to Be Happy_ (1958) examined **elite identity crises** and societal transformation during Independence, focusing on the personal identity and the intersection of public and private lives for the Western-educated Indian elite.

### **Theme 2: Emergence of Women Writers & Struggles in a Patriarchal Society**

**A. Theoretical Framework:** The 1950s-1970s saw the **emergence of women writers** in IEF, who began exploring women’s experiences in relation to tradition and modernity. Their works often delved into the **psychological depth and emotional struggles of women within patriarchal systems**. These writers faced significant challenges, as their **gender could determine their experiences**, leading to **denied experiences and limited access to power, books, and media**. Consequently, women writers often had to assert their place in the literary space, confronting issues similar to those faced by "any other middle class working woman".

**B. Case Study Analysis:** Women novelists of this era provided significant insights into these themes:

- **Anita Desai** is a prominent figure whose themes include **existential anxiety, emotional isolation, and the inner lives of women**. Her novel, _Cry, the Peacock_ (1963), is a psychological exploration of a woman’s unraveling marriage. _Clear Light of Day_ (1980) addresses tensions within a post-partition Indian family and the **status of women**, particularly their roles as mothers and caretakers, in modern-day India. The discussion in the "Our Novels In English Full Movie" transcript characterizes Desai's writing, exemplified by _In Custody_, as "very beautiful" but concerning a "refined existence" and an "unhappy, slightly neurotic me sahib world" [0:59:04-0:59:22]. This commentary highlights the challenges women writers faced in treating such subjects with the right amount of seriousness without diminishing or overdoing them [0:59:45-1:00:00].
- **Kamala Markandaya**’s _Nectar in a Sieve_ (1954) offers a poignant portrayal of a **peasant woman’s struggle for survival** and happiness in a changing India. Her "strident" defense of English as "my language, this is my voice" [0:59:58-1:00:00] can be interpreted as an act of asserting female agency and challenging patriarchal norms within the literary sphere.
- **Nayantara Sahgal** specifically focused on the **struggles of women in patriarchal systems**. Her novel _Rich Like Us_ (1985), set during the Emergency, intertwines a critique of authoritarianism with explicit themes of **gender oppression**.
- **Shashi Deshpande**, though a slightly later figure, is recognized for having "sketched with sensitive detail the **conflicts and inner lives of urban middleclass women**", further contributing to the representation of women's experiences during this broader period.
